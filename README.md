1.How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

  Interpreting user needs so that you can implement them into a program is the most important step to develop good software. Using "user stories" simplifies this process because it lets you see what the user wants in their own words. User Stories should detail how the product should look as well as the expected behavior so that you can deliver the product that the user needs. 



2.How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

  My approach to developing programs is mostly a trial and error process. I like to frequently test what I've done to make sure that everything is coming together. I feel like this is suited to an Agile approach like Scrum because I believe that continuous feedback is the key to successful development. Ultimately, I hope I can implement sprints in my work so that I can deliver usable products sooner. 




3.What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

  A good software development team member is someone who is independent, dependable and an excellent communicator. I believe these are the most important traits to focus on and develop to prepare to work in the field.
